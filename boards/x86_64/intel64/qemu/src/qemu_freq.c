 * Name: x86_64_timer_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initializes all platform-specific timer facilities.  This function is
 *   called early in the initialization sequence by up_intialize().
 *   On return, the current up-time should be available from
 *   up_timer_gettime() and the interval timer is ready for use (but not
 *   actively timing.
 *
 *   Provided by platform-specific code and called from the architecture-
 *   specific logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Called early in the initialization sequence before any special
 *   concurrency protections are required.
