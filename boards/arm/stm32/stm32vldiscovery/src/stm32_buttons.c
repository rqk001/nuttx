 * Button support.

 * Description:
 *   board_button_initialize() must be called to initialize button resources.  After
 *   that, board_buttons() may be called to collect the current state of all
 *   buttons or board_button_irq() may be called to register button interrupt
 *   handlers.
 *
 *   After board_button_initialize() has been called, board_buttons() may be called to
 *   collect the state of all buttons.  board_buttons() returns an 32-bit bit set
 *   with each bit associated with a button.  See the BUTTON_*_BIT and JOYSTICK_*_BIT
 *   definitions in board.h for the meaning of each bit.
 *
 *   board_button_irq() may be called to register an interrupt handler that will
 *   be called when a button is depressed or released.  The ID value is a
 *   button enumeration value that uniquely identifies a button resource. See the
 *   BUTTON_* and JOYSTICK_* definitions in board.h for the meaning of enumeration
 *   value.
