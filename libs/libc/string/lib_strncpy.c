 * Name: strncpy
 *
 * Description:
 *   Copies the string pointed to by 'src' (including the terminating NUL
 *   character) into the array pointed to by 'dest'.  strncpy() will not
 *   copy more than 'n' bytes from 'src' to 'dest' array (including the
 *   NUL terminator).
 *
 *   If the array pointed to by 'src' is a string that is shorter than 'n'
 *   bytes, NUL characters will be appended to the copy in the array
 *   pointed to by 'dest', until 'n' bytes in all are written.
 *
 *   If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
 *   undefined.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The strncpy() function returns the pointer to 'dest'
 *
